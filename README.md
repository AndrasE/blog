  A basic full stack application using Ejs & MongoDb 
</h3>

## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

This app was part of the lecture I followed on Udemy. I felt fascinated by using EJS with MongoDb the user could interact with the App and send their own post to a database, which gets displayed once the page gets refreashed. Altough it is a simple App, for me did worth more so I redisigned it and added some @medias for small devices. I think it could be a good start for beginner trying to build similar applications. 

Take care, code safe! ðŸ’»

ps: App is deployed both on heroke eco-tier(no more free ðŸ˜¥) and cyclic. If you would like to compare the speed of the two feel free to do so. My findings is that heroku servers needs longer time to spin up, but once is up it feels more responsive. <br>
