  Simple blog app using Ejs, Express & MongoDb
</h3>

## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

This app was part of a **[Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp)** lecture I followed, and I found the combination of **[EJS](https://ejs.co/)** with **[MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)** fascinating. Users can interact with the app by submitting their own posts, which are stored in a database and displayed upon page refresh. Although it's a simple app, I gained valuable insights from it and later revamped it by adding media queries for better mobile responsiveness. I believe it's a great starting point for beginners looking to build similar applications.

Deployed on Heroku's eco-dyno, please note that it may take a few seconds for the server to wake up.
