  A basic full stack application using Ejs & MongoDb 
</h3>

## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

This app was part of the lecture I followed on Udemy. I felt fascinate that using EJS with MongoDb the user could interact with the App and send their own post to a database, which gets displayed once the page gets refreashed. Altough it is a simple App, for me did worth more so I redisigned it and added some @media for small devices.
