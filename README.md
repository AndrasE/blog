  A basic full stack application 
  <br>
  Ejs with Express & MongoDb 
</h3>

## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

This app was part of the lecture I followed on <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Udemy</a>. I felt fascinated by using EJS with MongoDb as here the users can interact with the App and send their own posts to a database which then get displayed once the page is being refreshed. Although it is a simple App, I gained great benefits from it and redesigned it, adding some @medias for small devices. I think it could be a good start for beginners who are trying to build similar applications. 

Take care, code safe! ðŸ’»

ps: App is deployed both on heroku eco-tier (no more free ðŸ˜¥) and cyclic. If you would like to compare the speed of the two, feel free to do so. My finding is that heroku servers needs longer time to spin up, but once it is up it feels more responsive. <br>
